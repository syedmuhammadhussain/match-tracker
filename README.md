# Match Tracker

Match Tracker is a Next.js application built with the App Router (Next.js 15+), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and SWR. It fetches live match data via an API, displays team names, scores, and match statuses, and supports client-side revalidation without a full page reloadâ€”all while leveraging SSR for the initial load.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**  
  Initial data is fetched on the server for performance and SEO benefits.
  
- **Client-Side Revalidation:**  
  Uses SWR to revalidate and refresh data on the client without reloading the page.
  
- **Live Data Updates:**  
  Data auto-refreshes on tab focus and via a manual Refresh button.
  
- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  Rapidly build a responsive UI with utility-first styling.
  
- **TypeScript:**  
  Ensures type safety and a better developer experience.
